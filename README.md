# VolumeRendering_OGL  
Supporting sample application for my code project article [Getting started with Volume rendering using OpenGL](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/352270/Getting-started-with-Volume-Rendering). It starts off with the 2D texture approach and explains the issues if we use it, and ends with the 3D texture technique.
